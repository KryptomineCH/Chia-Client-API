    <Description>CHIA-RPC is a C# Nuget library that allows developers to easily communicate with the Chia client. It provides a wrapper for making requests, sending transactions, and minting, making it a versatile tool for interacting with the Chia blockchain. With CHIA-RPC, you can easily integrate Chia functionality into your C# projects.</Description>

    <PackageReleaseNotes>1.8.1.16: added implicit conversion and critical bug workaround
- added a workaround where the getTransactions endpoint returns an amount of 0 in an unknown circumstance. In this unexpected case, the application would crash when calling GetPrimaryCoin on the transaction.
  Now returns the first  coin if acount is 0 but coins are specified
- added an implicit conversion from TradeRecord to GetOffer

1.8.1.15: fixed critical bug introduced in 1.8.1.11
- fixed critical bug in 1.8.1.11 where I thought fee (in mojos) would be of type ulong. But its decimal o.O
- removed old GestStandardTransactionFeeEstimate (Use GetFeeEstimate instead)
- improvement on GetFeeEstimate_RPC (changed from explicit to implicit operator)
- improvements for unit tests

1.8.1.14: File handling fixed
- Wrote unit test for file handling. The naming when offering a FileInfo is now actually fixed.

1.8.1.13: Fix for RPC file extension
- Fixed the file naming if the file path was specified with a '.' as an extension.

1.8.12: Hotfix for offers
- Offers do not get updated when modifying offers_in_xch (added workaround. .NET issue).

1.8.1.11: GetFeeEstimate improvements
- Improvements on XML documentation.
- Added explicit conversion so that the API can be called directly with a DateTime.
- Fixed a fee value which was displayed in decimal rather than ulong.
- Returned time array can now also be viewed in TimeSpan.

1.8.1.10: Convenience upgrades
- Added overloads so that files can now be loaded and exported with FileInfo.
- Added an implicit conversion to GetCatOfferSummary.
- Added constructor to GetFeeEstimate which accepts a single Time rather than an array.
- Slight improvement in GetFeeEstimate_RPC Documentation.

1.8.1.9: Hotfix and offering improvements
- Added null value hotfix.
- Improved XML coded documentation for offers.
- Added unit test for offer creation.
- Improved constructor for offerings.
- Improved cancel offers endpoint.

1.8.1.8: Hotfix
- Hotfix for 1.8.1.7 null reference issue.

1.8.1.7: Allow decimal
- This is a rather big update which adds decimal properties to many endpoints. These decimal properties allow to read/write amounts in XCH rather than having to manually do the conversion to mojos.

1.8.1.6: Improve Transaction and response classes
- Added functionality to obtain primary coin from transaction (please test this!!!)
- Reworked objects and code to include the raw request answer data.

1.8.1.5: Improve wait for transaction code
- Renamed wallet API to confirm.
- Created full node API to wait for coin creation (this should really await transaction completeness).
- Added an implicit conversion for the checkers.
- Added TimeSpan code for the await.

1.8.1.4: Improve SendTransaction_RPC
- Added a global variable in General_NS.GlobalVar which specifies the amount of mojos which make up one chia.
- Improved constructor of SendTransaction_RPC to allow for different combinations of ulong (mojos) and double (XCH) for amount and fee.

1.8.1.3: Improve Constructor for SendTransaction_RPC
- Now has default null values which can be left blank.

1.8.1.2: Improvements to GetFeeEstimate
- Minor documentation typo fix.
- Fixed either/or condition in a class.
- Major improvement for GetFeeEstimates constructor now properly reflecting either spend or cost condition and adding standard chia transaction value, hence making `GetStandardTransactionFeeEstimate` obsolete.
- Added property to `GetFeeEstimate_Response` which displays fee in full chia fraction rather than in Mojos.

1.8.1.1: The updates are mostly in Chia-RPC. This update ensures compatibility with Chia-RPC 1.8.1.1 and brings the following improvements:
- Major documentation update.
- Added constructors to all RPC endpoints.
- A few minor bugfixes.
- Added further implicit conversions.
